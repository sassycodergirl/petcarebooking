        <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You will also need the receipt or proof of purchase (digital or physical)</p>
        <p>Returns or exchanges of products in the following categories will not be accepted (unless

        <p>Unopened units in a combo product (ex: If a product comprises 12 packets and out of it, 11
